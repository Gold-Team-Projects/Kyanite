# Kyanite
The first mobile hacking station for full-scope pentesting.
## How does it work?
Kyanite needs two parts to work successfully:
- A **server** (a computer of some kind)
- A **client** (a phone, or other mobile device)
Combining these two devices with Kyanite allows users to perform full-scope pentests on targets.

Kyanite should only be used with express permission from the target. We are not responsible for actions performed using Kyanite.
